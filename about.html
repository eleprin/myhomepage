<p>
	Hello, <br>
	my name is Daniel Wagner! <br>
	I'm grateful for you visiting my website!
</p>

<p>
	As for me as a person, <br>
	when I boil it down: I'm a learner. <br>
	Learning is my raison d'etre. <br>
	It just makes me really happy! <br>
	So I've realized that it's what I want to do with my life.
</p>

<p>	I've also realized that spending a lot of time <br>
	just reading about stuff, while it's interesting, <br>
	means I'm actually missing out on experience and knowledge <br> 
	that comes from using what I have learnt. <br>
	Because while I am a learner, I also want to be a builder, <br>
	and there are many things I want to build with my code! <br>
	So, here we are! I'm making my own website!
</p>

<p>	If you're curious about my interests or contact info, <br>
check out my <a href="interests.html">Interests</a> or <a href="contact.html"> Contact Info</a> page.
